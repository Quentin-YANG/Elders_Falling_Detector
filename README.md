Brife Description: 
Many elderly people can suffer accidental falls. If medical attention is not given immediately, these accidents will have serious consequences. From statis- tics, it has been shown that serious consequences are not due to fall itself in most of the cases, but rather are due to delay to treatment. Post-fall consequences will be able to reduce if it is possible to alert relief personnel immediately. The aim of this project is to develop a new solution to this fall-detection and alerting problem using a Pebble Watch. Pebble Watch is an electronic wrist watch launched by Kickstarter. The watch has three axis accelerometer, magnetometer, ambient light sensor, vibration motor and a small monochrome 1.26 inch LCD. The watch can communicate with a mobile phone or tablet running on either iOS (Apple) or Android (programs are available from developers site). Here, fall-detection is achieved using three axis accelerometer and then communi- cate to a mobile phone to trigger phone call to relief personnel.
